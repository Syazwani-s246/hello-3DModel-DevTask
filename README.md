# Three.js Development Task

Welcome to my first attempt at using Three.js for a development task. The purpose of this task is to insert a 3D model into a web page, provide options for users to change the colors of any materials using color UI buttons, and allow users to view the 3D model in Augmented Reality (AR) using a model viewer.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_URL>
   ```

2. **Initialize npm**: Run the following command in the terminal to initialize a new npm project. This command will create a `package.json` file in your project folder.
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Install Three.js**: Run the following command to install Three.js as a dependency for your project.
   ```
   npm install --save three
   ```

4. **Install Vite (or Another Build Tool)**: Run the following command to install Vite as a development dependency for your project.
   ```
   npm install --save-dev vite
   ```

5. **Run Vite**: After installing Vite, you can start your development server by running the following command in the terminal.
   ```
   npx vite
   ```

6. **Access Your Project**: If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a URL like `http://localhost:3000` appear in your terminal. Open this URL in your web browser to view your Three.js project.
